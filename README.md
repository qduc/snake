Another experiment I made up to try out [React library](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

View a live demo at <https://qduc.github.io/snake/>

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and install it.

### Installing

Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

Start localhost web server

Wait a moment for the script to build the app then a new browser tab will be opened at <https://localhost:3000>
